# godot_cube_test_shaders
initial tests with godot pixel art.

* Initial outlines shader from [this post](https://godotshaders.com/shader/thick-3d-screen-space-depth-normal-based-outline-shader/), almost entirely re-written to work closer to what I'm looking for, and frankly to make more sense of what's happening inside it.
* Pixel shader adapted from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mg_V27arKdg), once again adapted heavily to allow pixels to follow the camera, and preventin aliasing artifacts when moving around.
